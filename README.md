Greetings! I'm a highly skilled Fullstack Developer with 2 years of professional experience, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Jamhuuriyo University of Science & Technology.
 With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I possess a diverse skill set that enables me to create exceptional web applications. My goal is to build seamless, user-friendly solutions that cater to the unique needs of businesses and users.

On the front-end, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing popular frameworks like React and Svelte to craft engaging and intuitive user interfaces. I pay meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that my designs are visually appealing and provide an outstanding user experience.

 When it comes to the back-end, I have hands-on experience with Php and JavaScript (Node.js). I excel in developing robust RESTful APIs, working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, and implementing stringent security measures to protect sensitive data.
